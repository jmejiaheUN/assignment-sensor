# AI Prompt Log (condensed)
- Planned a Go-based daemon with interval flag, ISO-8601 logs, /tmp fallback, SIGTERM handling, systemd unit at multi-user.target.
- Generated code + Makefile + unit + tests.
- Iterated fixes: Makefile tabs, go module init, io.NopCloser type mismatch, sudo PATH during install, permission errors under systemd.
- Added dedicated service user and /var/log path; documented that manual runs still default to /tmp.
